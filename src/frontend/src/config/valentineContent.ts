    story: `Happy Valentine's Day, my love ❤️

After reading what you wrote, I just sat quietly for a few minutes… because honestly, I've never felt so loved and understood in my life. The way you see me, accept me, and choose me every single day means more than I can ever explain.

You say I healed you, but you don't realize how much you've changed me too. You've made me softer, calmer, more patient. You've shown me what real love feels like not the loud kind, but the safe kind. The kind where I can be completely myself without fear.

I know I'm not perfect. I know I can be moody, stubborn, sometimes difficult. But the fact that you still choose to stay, to understand me, to love me through everything that's something I will never take for granted.

With you, love doesn't feel temporary. It feels steady. It feels like home. It feels like something I want for a lifetime.

I don't just want you for today. I want you in my normal days, my stressful days, my happiest days, and even my worst days. I want to grow with you, laugh with you, fight with you and still choose each other at the end of the day.

And don't worry… humare rishte ko kisi ki nazar nahi lagegi 🧿 because what we have is real, pure, and built with genuine feelings.

Thank you for being in my life. Thank you for loving me the way you do. I promise to protect your heart the same way you protect mine.

I love you. Always. ❤️✨`,
